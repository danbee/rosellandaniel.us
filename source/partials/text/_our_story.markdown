Daniel lives in London and is a software developer at thoughtbot. Rosella lives
in New York and runs the alumni relations office at Teachers College. This
summer, Daniel was on an extended stay in NYC, and when they met an
instant connection sparked.

When Daniel returned to London in August, they expected he'd be moving back
permanently in a few months time. Thanks to WhatsApp and FaceTime, living
"Across the Pond" from each other didn't seem like such a great distance after
all. It didn't take too many visits back and forth before these two were head
over heels in love! Daniel even spent Christmas in Texas with the Garcías, where
he passed an age-old family test; surviving his first trip to her family ranch
in South Texas. It was also on this trip that Daniel mustered the courage to ask
her dad for Rosella's hand in marriage. Daniel proposed in February in London
when Rosella came over to meet his family.

Daniel's impending move date was unfortunately pushed further and further back
as the company considered which visa route would be the best way to move forward
with his inter-company transfer. Gradually, that "pond" grew enormous and that
five hour time difference felt unbearable. However, a few more international
romantic rendezvous helped. Thank goodness these two share the same goal of
collecting passport stamps!

At the end of tough goodbye in a Bangkok airport in early May, they decided
that they had had enough of the transatlantic challenges, so they vowed to do
whatever it takes to be together, as soon as possible. Including eloping!
Daniel was already planning to visit over Memorial Day weekend to see his
fiancée and celebrate her nephew's first birthday in San Antonio. So Rosella
and Daniel are getting married on May 28 at her parents house in Helotes, TX!

But this isn't the end of their global adventure. Rosella will be
moving to London later this summer to join her groom, and they'll be there about
a year as they make preparations to return to the States together. Stay tuned
for tales from their ongoing adventures!
