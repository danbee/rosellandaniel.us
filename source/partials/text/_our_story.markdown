Daniel is a software developer at Thoughtbot from England. Rosella runs the alumni relations office at Teachers College in New York. In the summer of 2016, Daniel was on an extended stay in NYC, and when they met an
instant connection sparked.

When Daniel returned to London in August, they expected he'd be moving back
permanently in a few months time. Thanks to WhatsApp and FaceTime, living
"across the Pond" from each other didn't seem like such a great distance after
all. It didn't take too many visits back and forth before these two were head
over heels in love! Daniel even spent Christmas in Texas with the Garcías, where
he passed an age-old family test: surviving his first trip to her family ranch
in South Texas. It was also on this trip that Daniel mustered the courage to ask
her dad for Rosella's hand in marriage. Daniel proposed in February in London
when Rosella came over to meet his family.

Daniel's impending move date was unfortunately pushed further and further back
as the company considered which visa route would be the best way to move forward
with his inter-company transfer. Gradually, that "pond" grew enormous and that
five hour time difference felt unbearable. However, a few more international
romantic rendezvous helped. Thank goodness these two share the same goal of
collecting passport stamps!

At the end of a tough goodbye in a Bangkok airport in early May, they decided
that they had had enough of the transatlantic challenges, so they vowed to do
whatever it would take to be together, as soon as possible. Including eloping! Daniel
was already planning to visit over Memorial Day weekend to see his fiancée and
celebrate her nephew's first birthday in San Antonio. So Rosella and Daniel decided to 
get married---and they only gave their families 12 days notice! 

Rosella and Daniel said "I Do!" on <strong> May 28, 2017 </strong> in <strong> Helotes, TX </strong> at an intimate reception at Pedrotti Ranch. And despite the short notice---and with the help of their amazing family---they pulled off quite the fiesta to celebrate their love!  

At the wedding, it was still unclear how long it would be before the bride and groom could actually live in the same country together or on which continent their first address might be. But once they were married, (and after a meeting with their immigration attorney) they realized that Daniel could stay in New York and that they could put an end to the long distances between them! So Daniel and Rosella can be found, for now, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Stay tuned for tales from their ongoing adventures!
